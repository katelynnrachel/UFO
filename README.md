# UFO

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to use JavaScript Language to build a dymanic webpage based on UFO sighting data around the United States. Users are able to filter the information through criteria such date, city, state, country, and shape.

Here is the dyanmic webpage created through JavaScript and html text. To filter the information for multiple or a sigular criteria, a user can use the table filter on the left side of the screen. For example, if someone wanted to see the comments for a UFO sighting in California, where the shape was a "light," then they can type those words into the respective filters and get the resulting dat, as seen below.

## Summary
### Drawbacks
While this webpage has made the user experience easier, there are still potential drawbacks. For example, anyone using the page would not know what the options for each criteria are without looking through the table first before filtering the information. In addition, the filters are case sensitive, meaning that the filters would not recognize if a letter is accidentally capitalized (for example: "Ca" instead of "ca") which could produce inaccurate results.

### Recommendations
1. My first recommendation would be to hace a dropdown menu at each of the filter inputs, so that users will know what their options are ahead of time rather than having to go through the table.
2. I would also connect the page to a live data source, as this one is already outdated and therefore users can recieve current information about UFO sightings across the US.
